**Ed and Jamilah worked together pair programming this lab excercide. It took about 4 hours**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, cloned the repository
  2. Next, we reviewed the files in the starter code
  3. Next, we realized that we needed to review class notes and video before programming
  4. Next, we step by step loaded node globally, JSON packages, and express
  5. Next, we went through the code on server.js and worked through get, post, respond and listen 
  6. Testing code on nodemon, local host and live-server
  7. Then we worked on the reviews and comments
